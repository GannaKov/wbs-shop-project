    <h3>We have the freedom to choose, so we chose to be good.</h3>
    <p>At Mane Ethical Hairdressing we have exercised our power to choose, and in doing so we have created a space and a community of shared values. Being sustainable and ethical isn't always the easiest of paths, however we made a conscious effort to explore and research salon options that positively contribute to making a better world.
We hope you enjoy what we have created.</p>
